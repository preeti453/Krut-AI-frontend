                    In a highly competitive e-commerce space, where creating content is still tough using different AI tools, that leads to a loss in ROI, reduced productivity, and a lot of time consumption because 85% of the creators still have no prompt writing skills. Thatâ€™s where Krut AI emerges as an AI co-pilot for e-commerce brands that generate high-quality custom content creation without being an expert prompter by offering time efficiency, cost-saving, and increased efficiency.
